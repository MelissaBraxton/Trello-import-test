Better understand how users access permitting sites \n2. Help identify possible workflow improvements for users\n3. Ultimately help end users more quickly and easily find a specific permit through better SEO with multiple pages referencing permits\n4. Understand the value of easier access to analyze traffic and user patterns within the Open Forest system vs outside the Open Forest system\n5. Clearly define first steps for admin users to potentially access and manage all their apps from one simple interface from the Open Forest landing page\n6.
